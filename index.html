  <h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>
  <p>Surfing is a surface water sport in which the wave rider, referred to as a surfer, rides on the forward or face of
    a moving wave, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found in
    the ocean, but can also be found in lakes or rivers in the form of a standing wave or tidal bore. However, surfers
    can also utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes and the waves created in artificial wave pools.</p>
